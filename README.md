content-ideas
=============

This is a place to submit ideas for content you'd like me to produce.

I love creating open source software that benifits everyone.  But the sad truth in our world is that writing high-quality software that solves real-world problems and then giving it away for free isn't a great way to make a living.  The companies who benifit the most from my work feel the least incentive to pay me for it.

This repo is a place to place orders about the kind of educational content or libraries you'd like to see exist.

Some ideas are:

 - Deep Dive Series into JavaScript Fundamentals (screencast and/or interactive workshop format)
 - Learning to Program Through Casual Games
 - Game Programming for Experienced Web Developers
 - Sampling of Different Development Workflows

If you have an idea or wish to comment on an existing one, please file an issue against this repo!
